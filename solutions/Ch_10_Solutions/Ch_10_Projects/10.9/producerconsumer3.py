File: producerconsumer3.py
Project 10.9
Producer-consumer demo with synchronization.
Producer and consumer both access shared data a given number
of times. They sleep a random interval before each access.
The data must be produced before it is consumed, and be produced
and consumed just once.
The condition and Boolean flag on the shared data guarantee that
the producer and consumer access the data in the correct order.
